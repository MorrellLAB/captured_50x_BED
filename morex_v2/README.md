## Morex v2 regions file

Detailed methods are described in the main readme file: https://github.com/MorrellLAB/captured_50x_BED.

Here, I provide a brief description of the data files that are useful:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `parts.bed` | This contains the split chromosome positions for Morex v2 and was used in the [`Barley_Parts_to_Pseudomolecules.py` script](https://github.com/MorrellLAB/File_Conversions/blob/master/Barley_Parts_to_Pseudomolecules.py) |
| `captured_50x_morex_v2_partsRef.bed` | The regions relative to Morex v2 using parts coordinates that had >50x depth. |
| `captured_50x_morex_v2_pseudomolecules.bed` | The regions relative to Morex v2 full coordinates that had >50x depth. |

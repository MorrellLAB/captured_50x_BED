# captured_50x_BED

This repository contains scripts that were used to make the `captured_50x_morex_v2_ref.bed` file.

The Morex reads were from the [Mascher et al. 2013 *The Plant Journal* paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241023/). The SRA BioProject number for the reads is: **PRJEB1810**. The SRA number for the reads is: [**ERP002487**](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?study=ERP002487).

In this case, we are using Morex sample: **ERR271706**

Link to EMBL-EBI is: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/ERR271706

Scripts used to make the `captured_50x_partsRef.bed` file for Morex v1 are located in the `morex_v1` directory. Methods described below are for `morex_v2`.
